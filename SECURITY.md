## Security Disclosure Policy

Email [dbtedman@gmail.com](mailto:dbtedman@gmail.com) with details about the security issue.

## Security Update Policy

Best efforts will be taken to apply code fixes or update vulnerable packages as soon as is possible, this will usually be within a couple of days.

### Broken Access Control

[A01:2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control/)

-   [GitHub Secret scanning](https://github.com/features/security) detects secrets incorrectly committed into the
    repository.

### Security Misconfiguration

[A05:2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/), [API7:2019](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa7-security-misconfiguration.md)

_No relevant mitigations are in place._

### Vulnerable and Outdated Components

[A06:2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)

-   [Snyk](https://snyk.io) or [GitHub Dependabot](https://github.com/features/security) scans Composer and NPM dependencies for know vulnerabilities and creates pull requests to
    resolve the vulnerabilities when available.
-   `roave/security-advisories` package blocks the installation of vulnerable Composer packages.

### Identification and Authentication Failures

[A07:2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/), [API2:2019](https://github.com/OWASP/API-Security/blob/master/2019/en/src/0xa2-broken-user-authentication.md)

-   Third party dependencies are carefully selected and described with explicit version numbers in `composer.json`
    and `package.json`.
-   [Snyk](https://snyk.io) or [GitHub Dependabot](https://github.com/features/security) will raise an alert if a
    suspicious package, or version of a package is being depended upon.
-   Dependencies required during development are segregated from those required during operation of this plugin.
